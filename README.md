# Project Title
Efficacy of in-code documentation versus separate documentation files in software maintenance 


## Scope
Software development teams often debate the best practice for documentation: either embedding comments and docstrings directly within the source code or maintaining separate, comprehensive documentation files (like a Wiki or PDF). The problem is that there is a lack of empirical data on which method actually leads to better long-term software maintainability and developer productivity. 


## Problem
* Current software engineering practices lack quantitative metrics to determine the optimal approach for software documentation. 

## Tech Stack
* Git
* VS Code
